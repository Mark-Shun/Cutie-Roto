Cutie Roto is a fork of [Cutie](https://github.com/hkchengrex/Cutie), and is designed to be a user friendly tool for AI assisted rotoscoping of video clips. It serves as a free alternative to commercial solutions such as Adobeâ€™s Roto Brush or DaVinci Resolve Magic Mask. This tool is still in early development. It is generally less accurate than manual rotoscoping, but can usually give a pretty good result with little effort.

### Changes from Cutie:
- Downloadable package for windows users
- Launcher to select a video file to work on
- New export video dialog
- Zoomed minimap inspired from [XMem](https://github.com/hkchengrex/XMem)
- Ability to import black and white mattes as a mask
- Additional click segmentation model trained on anime
- Simplified interface
